            It doesn’t ask you to follow any religion or heavy spirituality.

            the tiny satisfaction after writing one line before you close the app.

          <p class="section-subtitle">To help you feel safe using Kamidana, here are some common questions.</p>
          <div class="section-body">
            <p>
              <strong>Q. Does this app promote any religion?</strong><br />
              A. No. Kamidana is a Shinto-inspired self-care and journaling app.
              It borrows gentle elements from Shinto and the Japanese calendar,
              but it doesn’t promote any particular belief, and it never asks you to join or convert to anything.
              You can simply use it as a light tool for everyday reflection, gratitude, and letting go.
              You don’t need any special knowledge about Shinto —
              if you simply want to take better care of yourself today, this app is for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Q. Is it free? What’s the difference with Premium?</strong><br />
              A. The core features — prayer, wishes, release, and diary — are available for free.
              The Premium plan adds no banner ads, a calendar view, additional auspicious / inauspicious days,
              and special fox moments in the Fox Den, for users who want a quieter, more focused space.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Q. Is my data private? Can others see what I write?</strong><br />
              A. Your prayers, wishes, and diary entries are stored only on your device.
              They are not uploaded to our servers and are never shown to other users.
              We also do not send this content to AI services or use it to train any AI models.
              Unless you choose extra backup features yourself,
              your entries stay as notes known only to you and your phone.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Q. I usually can’t keep up with journaling apps. Will this work for me?</strong><br />
              A. Kamidana is designed around tiny actions — just one line, just one release.
              You don’t have to write every day.
              Even if you open it only when you remember,
              each small line still becomes part of your emotional record.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Q. How can I move my data when I change phones?</strong><br />
                A. You can transfer part of your data by using the backup feature.
                From the app settings, create a backup to your Google Drive, then install Kamidana on your new device and restore from that backup using the same account.
                Please note that some items are stored only on the device, so your new shrine may not match the previous one perfectly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Q. How can I report a bug or problem?</strong><br />
                A. You can send a report from the app settings under “Feedback / Contact”.
                You can also use the <a href="https://forms.gle/nM3EQSn5T5iQ147n6" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kamidana message box</a>.
                If possible, please include your device model, OS version, app version, and what you were doing when the issue happened. That helps us a lot.

            You don't have to write a lot. You don't need the perfect words.
            Just one line is enough for today.
            May that single line become a quiet support for the you of tomorrow.
