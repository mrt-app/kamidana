                    "I'll wake up early, go for a jog, study a new language, make a proper breakfast—" Morning routine
                    plans are always ambitious. And they almost always collapse within three days.
                </p>
                <p class="journal-lead">
                    We blame it on not being able to wake up early. But that's not actually the problem. <strong>The
                        real issue is that the very first action after waking up hasn't been decided.</strong>

            <section>
                <h2>What Happens in the First Second</h2>
                <p>
                    For most people, the morning goes like this: Wake up → reach for phone (unconscious) → open social
                    media (unconscious) → scroll for 20 minutes → "I'm already late" → morning routine cancelled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Steps 2 and 3 aren't conscious choices. They're <strong>automated behaviors</strong> — deeply
                    ingrained habits. The enemy of your morning routine isn't laziness. It's <strong>the existing
                        "morning autopilot" that's already programmed in</strong>.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>How Habits Work (Behavioral Science)</h2>
                <p>
                    Behavioral science tells us habits have three components: <strong>trigger → action →
                        reward</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your current morning phone habit: trigger = waking up, action = grab phone and open social media,
                    reward = dopamine hit from new information and notifications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Telling yourself "don't touch the phone" is unrealistic — it's sitting right there, doubling as your
                    alarm clock. <strong>What you need to do is decide, the night before, what app you'll open
                        first</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The updated loop: trigger = waking up and grabbing your phone (unchanged), action = <strong>open one
                        predetermined app</strong>, reward = a sense of calm, the feeling that "today started on my
                    terms."
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>What Makes a Good "First App"?</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>1. It finishes in under 60 seconds.</strong> If the first action is a 10-minute meditation
                    or 30-minute jog, the barrier is too high. The first action is a warm-up — a trigger for the rest of
                    the routine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>2. There's no way to "do it wrong."</strong> Meditation has "I couldn't focus." Running has
                    "I couldn't run far enough." When the morning's first action carries judgment, you'll start avoiding
                    it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3. It naturally leads to the next action.</strong> A good first action is like the first
                    domino. After one minute of quiet, "maybe I'll stretch" or "I'll make coffee properly today" arises
                    naturally.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Why Omairi Is Perfect for the First Second</h2>
                <p>
                    We propose <strong>digital omairi</strong> as your morning's first action.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time required: <strong>1 minute</strong> (vs. meditation 10–20 min, jogging 30 min)</li>
                    <li>Failure feeling: <strong>None</strong> (vs. meditation "couldn't focus," running "too tired")
                    </li>
                    <li>Equipment needed: <strong>Just your phone</strong> (vs. meditation needs quiet space, running
                        needs gear + weather)</li>
                    <li>Chain reaction to next action: <strong>Happens naturally</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Put your hands together and think "please watch over me today." That's it. There is literally
                    nothing you can get wrong.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>One Minute Changes the Day</h2>
                <p>
                    When the first minute shifts from social media to omairi, subsequent behavior changes in a chain
                    reaction. After omairi, people naturally think "maybe I'll stretch," "I'll make coffee mindfully,"
                    or "let me organize my day."
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>When the first minute is "time for yourself," that mode persists.</strong> This is the power
                    of the first second.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Your Action Item for Tonight</h2>
                <p>
                    If you want to start a morning routine, do just one thing tonight: <strong>Decide "Tomorrow morning,
                        the first thing I open on my phone will be ___" and move that app to the most prominent spot on
                        your home screen.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's all it takes for tomorrow's first second to be different. If you keep it up for a week,
                    congratulations — you have a morning routine. Jogging and language study can come later.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Morning routines fail not because of early rising, but because <strong>the "first second" isn't
                            designed</strong></li>
                    <li>Don't fight picking up your phone. <strong>Just change what you open first</strong></li>
                    <li>Choose a first action that's <strong>under 60 seconds, has no failure state, and triggers the
                            next action</strong></li>
                    <li>Omairi meets all three criteria naturally</li>
                </ul>
