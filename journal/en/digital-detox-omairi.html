                    "Put down your phone." "Turn off notifications." "Delete social media for a week." — Digital detox
                    advice always sounds the same. And it almost never sticks.
                </p>
                <p class="journal-lead">
                    Most people try. They disable notifications, set screen time limits, ban their phones from the
                    bedroom. But within days, old habits return. This isn't a willpower issue. <strong>The goal of "not
                        using your phone" is structurally unrealistic</strong> in modern life.
                </p>
                <p class="journal-lead">
                    Your phone is your alarm clock, payment method, map, and work tool. "Don't use it" simply isn't an
                    option.

                <h2>Reframe: Change How You Use It</h2>
                <p>
                    What if we redefined digital detox from "don't use your phone" to "<strong>change how you use
                        it</strong>"?
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create phone-free time → Create time for <strong>quiet phone use</strong></li>
                    <li>Turn off all notifications → Just take back <strong>the first 1 minute</strong> before
                        notifications</li>
                    <li>Delete social media → Choose <strong>one app to open first</strong> instead of social media</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The key insight: don't create emptiness — <strong>decide what to fill it with in advance</strong>.
                    Our brains hate voids. If you create phone-free time, that void will quickly be filled with other
                    stimulation. Instead, <strong>prepare a "quiet action" ahead of time</strong>.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Digital Omairi: A New Option</h2>
                <p>
                    We propose a habit called <strong>digital omairi</strong> (digital prayer).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the morning, you pick up your phone (you do this every day anyway)</li>
                    <li>Instead of social media or news, <strong>open the Kamidana App first</strong></li>
                    <li>Place a digital offering (just a tap on the screen)</li>
                    <li>Close your eyes for a moment or put your hands together</li>
                    <li>Done. <strong>Total time: about 60 seconds</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You don't ban yourself from touching your phone. You just change the first minute. There's no "right
                    way" to do it and no failure state — unlike meditation, where "I couldn't focus" feels like a loss.
                    For Japanese people, putting your hands together is the most natural gesture in the world. No new
                    skill required.

            <section>
                <h2>Why the First Minute Matters (Behavioral Science)</h2>
                <p>
                    Habit research shows that behavior sticks when there's a clear <strong>trigger</strong> and
                    <strong>reward</strong>.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Picking up your phone in the morning (already established)</li>
                    <li><strong>Action</strong>: Opening the Kamidana App and doing omairi (the new behavior)</li>
                    <li><strong>Reward</strong>: A sense of calm at the start of your day (intrinsic satisfaction)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>One minute of difference can reshape how you spend the next several hours.</strong> This is
                    why the first minute matters.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Preventing the "Rebound Effect"</h2>
                <p>
                    Digital detox failures follow the same pattern as crash diets. "I'm never looking at my phone
                    again!" lasts three days, then stress triggers a rebound — you end up scrolling even more than
                    before, followed by guilt, followed by more scrolling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The antidote is simple: <strong>stop thinking in all-or-nothing terms</strong>. Just one minute in
                    the morning, with a quiet app. The rest of the day, use your phone however you want. Just protect
                    that first minute for yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interestingly, people who stick with this "just one minute" rule often find their screen time
                    naturally decreasing. Not because they're forcing it, but because <strong>"I don't really need to
                        check that right now"</strong> starts coming more easily.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>What Makes a Good "Quiet App"?</h2>
                <p>
                    The app you open in that first minute should meet three criteria:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Finishes in under 60 seconds</strong> — Anything longer raises the barrier to opening it
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>No "doing it right"</strong> — No scores, no streaks, no judgment</li>
                    <li><strong>Leaves you feeling calm, not excited</strong> — The reward is stillness, not stimulation
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Meditation apps, journaling apps, and nature sound apps are all candidates. But an <strong>omairi
                        app</strong> meets all three criteria most naturally.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Digital detox isn't about "not using your phone" — it's about <strong>changing how you use
                            it</strong></li>
                    <li>Reclaim just <strong>the first minute</strong> of your morning for something quiet</li>
                    <li>Omairi has no failure state, takes 60 seconds, and shapes the rest of your day</li>
                    <li><strong>"Just one" instead of "all or nothing"</strong> prevents the rebound</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Your phone isn't going away. So create <strong>one quiet place inside it</strong>. When the screen
                    lights up in the morning. When your thumb drifts toward the timeline. In that one second, open
                    something else. That's enough. <strong>Your first minute of the day belongs to you.</strong> That
                    alone makes today a little different from yesterday.
