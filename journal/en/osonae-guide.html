                    You've set up a kamidana (home shrine shelf), but now you're wondering:
                    <strong>"What do I actually put on it? How should I arrange things? Do I need to change them every
                        day?"</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="journal-lead">
                    This guide covers the essentials — the three basic offerings, placement rules, and replacement
                    timing — so you can start your practice with confidence, not confusion.

                <h2>The Three Essential Offerings</h2>
                <p>
                    The most important offerings for a kamidana are just three items, known collectively as
                    <strong>"nikku" (日供)</strong> — daily provisions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rice (kome):</strong> Washed uncooked rice, or a small portion of cooked rice. As
                        Japan's staple food, it represents the most fundamental offering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water (mizu):</strong> Ideally the first water drawn in the morning ("hatsu-mizu"). Tap
                        water is perfectly fine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Salt (shio):</strong> Preferably coarse natural salt, heaped into a small mound on a
                        dish.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    That's it. Start with just these three. <strong>Offering with sincerity within your means matters
                        far
                        more than perfection.</strong>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Placement Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    When facing the kamidana:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Center:</strong> Rice (the most important offering)</li>
                    <li><strong>Your right:</strong> Salt</li>
                    <li><strong>Your left:</strong> Water</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If you add sake (sacred rice wine), place a pair of sake cups on either side of the rice. Sakaki
                    (sacred evergreen branches) go in a pair of vases on the far left and right of the shelf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Short on space? A single row is fine. What matters most is that the offerings are placed on
                    <strong>clean vessels, in a clean space, with genuine care.</strong>
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>When to Replace</h2>
                <p>
                    "Do I really need to change them every day?" This is the most common question. Here's a practical
                    guide:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Every morning is the standard. This is the most important one to keep
                        fresh.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rice & Salt:</strong> Daily is ideal, but if that's too much, replacing them on the
                        <strong>1st and 15th of each month</strong> is a widely accepted practice.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Sakaki:</strong> Replace on the 1st and 15th. In summer, change the water daily to keep
                        them fresh longer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sake:</strong> Remove the same day you offer it, or the next day.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Used offerings are called <strong>"osagari"</strong> (お下がり) — gifts from the kami to you. Cook
                    with the rice, drink the water, use the salt. Nothing is wasted.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>When Life Gets Busy</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's be honest: changing the water every single morning is hard. Especially on days when you're
                    running late or barely slept.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most important thing isn't perfection — it's <strong>the intention to keep showing up.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even on a hectic morning, offering a single cup of water and closing your eyes for a few seconds is
                    a complete act of reverence. That counts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Kamidana App, the act of "exchanging offerings" is reimagined as a small daily ritual. You
                    place digital offerings on a digital shelf. It takes seconds. But that tiny interruption in your
                    routine creates a rhythm of stillness in an otherwise noisy day.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Summary: Consistency Over Perfection</h2>
                <p>
                    Kamidana offerings have traditional guidelines, but the most important rule is simply:
                    <strong>keep going.</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The three basics (rice, water, salt) are enough.</li>
                    <li>Placement: center = rice, right = salt, left = water.</li>
                    <li>Replace daily if you can; twice a month if you can't.</li>
                    <li>Used offerings are "osagari" — enjoy them with gratitude.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Don't aim for perfection. Aim for a "prayer habit" you can sustain at your own
                        pace.</strong>
                    That's the real art of living with a kamidana in the modern world.
