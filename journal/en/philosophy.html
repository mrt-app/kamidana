            Statistics suggest we check our smartphones nearly 300 times a day. Each time, we are met with a barrage of notifications, demands, and noise—constantly performing for the world, yet feeling more depleted.
          </p>
          <p class="journal-lead">
            When we designed the <strong>Kamidana App</strong>, we wanted to create a counter-balance: a digital sanctuary that allows you to return to your center for just one minute out of those 300 distractions.

          <h2>1. A Presence Without Judgment</h2>
          <p>
            In the app's backyard, you will encounter a small fox. It speaks in quiet, child-like reactions, but it never asks for your attention or evaluates your progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core philosophy of this fox is to be a <strong>"non-judgmental presence that maintains a comfortable distance."</strong> In a digital world where everything is rated and judged, having a companion that accepts you exactly as you are—without intruding on your space—is a rare and vital luxury.
          </p>

          <h2>2. The Single Daily "Call to Mindfulness"</h2>
          <p>
            Most apps compete for your attention dozens of times a day. We intentionally chose to ring the bell only once. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a day, we send a gentle nudge: "Time to refresh your offerings." This isn't a nagging alarm; it's a <strong>"Call to Prayer."</strong> Among the hundreds of times you check your phone for work or social media, this one alert is for <em>you</em>—a signal to step away from the noise and enter your private sanctuary.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. Carrying Your Sanctuary Everywhere</h2>
          <p>
            Our technology should serve our humanity, not exploit it. By tending to your altar and spending a silent minute with the fox, you engage in a deliberate act of intentionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kamidana App is not about productivity; it is a portable home for your heart. It’s a place where you are never judged, and where peace is always just one tap away.
