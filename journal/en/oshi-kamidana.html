            "My Oshi (fave) is so precious, they are basically a God..." 
            In Japan, this expression is common among fans. For many, an "Oshi"—the idol, actor, or character you support—has become more than just entertainment; they are a source of emotional support and vital energy.
          </p>
          <p class="journal-lead">
            However, between the noise of social media, constant comparisons with other fans, and the stress of ticket lotteries, do you ever feel "fandom burnout"?
          </p>
          <p class="journal-lead">
            Today, we introduce <strong>"Digital Oshi-Kamidana"</strong>—a new habit to protect your quiet time and cherish your favorite in a more sacred, mindful way.
          </p>
        </header>

        <section>
          <h2>1. Why Your "Oshi" Needs a Sacred Space</h2>
          <p>
            Originally, Shinto shrines and household altars (Kamidana) were places to express gratitude and center oneself. The same can be applied to your life as a fan.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Escape the Social Media Noise:</strong> A private place free from the opinions of others or endless official notifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Give Form to Pure Wishes:</strong> A place to hold your sincere prayers for their "concert success," "good health," or "new release hits."</li>
            <li><strong>Make Gratitude a Habit:</strong> A small daily moment to say, "Thank you for being you."</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Kamidana app proposes creating this space right inside your smartphone—the one thing you always carry with you.

          <h2>2. How to Master Your "Digital Oshi-Kamidana"</h2>
          <p>
            Turn your phone into a "Sacred Sanctuary" for your fave using these app features:
          </p>

          <h3>I. Register Their Image as an "Ofuda"</h3>
          <p>
            You can set your favorite photo of them as the central focus of the app. Every time you open the app, your "God" is there, quietly watching over you.
          </p>

          <h3>II. Use the "Journal" for Heartfelt Notes</h3>
          <p>
            Write down thoughts that are too personal for social media. "Your performance today was incredible," or "Thank you for the hard work." These become your private <strong>fandom log</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3>III. "Ema" Tablets for Wishes and Goals</h3>
          <p>
            Whether it's winning a concert ticket lottery or passing your own exams, write your goals on a digital Ema. Verbalizing your wishes helps calm anxiety and turns it into positive energy.
          </p>

          <h3>IV. "Oharai" to Delete SNS Fatigue</h3>
          <p>
            Seeing anti-comments or failing to get a ticket can leave a lingering "impurity" (*Kegare*) in your heart. Use the Oharai feature to write out those negative feelings and delete them instantly. It's a ritual to keep your fandom heart pure.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>3. The "Fox" and the "Backyard": A Gentle Distance</h2>
          <p>
            The best part of the Kamidana app is that <strong>it demands nothing from you</strong>. 
            The Fox character in the backyard doesn't judge your wishes or push you to "do more." It simply stays by your side.
          </p>
          <p>
            For fans exhausted by the fast-paced world of SNS, this quietness provides the ultimate healing space.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>4. Conclusion: Cherishing Them is Cherishing Yourself</h2>
          <p>
            To treasure your Oshi is to treasure your own passions. By using a digital altar as a filter, fandom evolves from mere "consumption" into a "mindful habit."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tonight, take just one minute before bed. Open your digital altar, and offer a quiet moment of gratitude.
