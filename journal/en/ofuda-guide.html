                <p class="journal-lead">
                    A Japanese friend handed you a paper talisman and said, "This is an ofuda — it's sacred, please take
                    care of it." Or maybe a relative sent one from Japan. Now it's sitting on your shelf and you're
                    wondering: <strong>"What exactly am I supposed to do with this?"</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="journal-lead">
                    You're not alone. According to kamidana (home shrine) shop owners, most customers come in not
                    because they visited a shrine themselves, but because someone gave them an ofuda and they want to
                    enshrine it properly.
                </p>
                <p class="journal-lead">
                    This guide covers everything you need to know: what ofuda actually are, where and how to enshrine
                    them, what to do without a kamidana, and how to properly return them when the time comes.

                <h2>What Is an Ofuda?</h2>
                <p>
                    An ofuda is a <strong>sacred talisman containing a portion of a deity's spirit</strong>
                    (<em>wakemitama</em>). Unlike omamori (charms you carry with you), ofuda are meant to be enshrined
                    at home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are three main types:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Jingū Taima:</strong> The ofuda of Ise Grand Shrine, distributed at shrines nationwide.
                        The most fundamental ofuda in Shinto practice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ujigami ofuda:</strong> From the local guardian shrine of your neighborhood.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sūkei-jinja ofuda:</strong> From a shrine you personally revere — often one you visited
                        during travel.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Placement Rules: Direction and Height</h2>
                <p>
                    When choosing where to place your ofuda, keep these principles in mind:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Above eye level:</strong> Ofuda should never be looked down upon. Place them on a high
                        shelf, atop furniture, or mounted on a wall.</li>
                    <li><strong>Facing south or east:</strong> The front of the ofuda should face south (ideal) or east.
                        These directions are associated with sunlight and positive energy.</li>
                    <li><strong>In a clean, bright space:</strong> Avoid placing ofuda near bathrooms or in cluttered
                        areas. A living room or a bright, well-visited room is ideal.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    That said, <strong>don't let the rules stop you from enshrining at all</strong>. A clean, respectful
                    spot where you feel at peace is always better than a "perfect" direction you can't achieve.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>No Kamidana? No Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    You don't need a traditional kamidana (shrine shelf) to enshrine ofuda properly. Modern alternatives
                    include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wall-mounted mini shelves:</strong> Designed specifically for ofuda. Many attach with
                        pins or adhesive strips — perfect for rentals.</li>
                    <li><strong>A clean shelf with white cloth:</strong> Lay a white cloth or <em>washi</em> paper on a
                        bookshelf and lean the ofuda against the wall.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ofuda stands:</strong> Simple wooden stands made specifically for ofuda. Compact and
                        elegant.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>What matters is reverence, not furniture.</strong> If you treat the ofuda with care, you're
                    already doing it right.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Stacking Order (When You Have Multiple Ofuda)</h2>
                <p>
                    If your kamidana has three doors (<em>sansha-zukuri</em>):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Center:</strong> Jingū Taima (Ise Grand Shrine)</li>
                    <li><strong>Your right:</strong> Ujigami (local shrine)</li>
                    <li><strong>Your left:</strong> Sūkei-jinja (personally revered shrine)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If your kamidana has one door (<em>issha-zukuri</em>), stack them front to back:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Front:</strong> Jingū Taima</li>
                    <li><strong>Middle:</strong> Ujigami</li>
                    <li><strong>Back:</strong> Sūkei-jinja</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Even without a kamidana, <strong>place the Jingū Taima in the most prominent position</strong>.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Returning Old Ofuda</h2>
                <p>
                    Ofuda are <strong>typically returned and renewed after one year</strong>. The most common timing is
                    during New Year: you receive a new ofuda and return the old one.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Return to the original shrine:</strong> The most respectful option. Look for the
                        <em>kosatsu-osamejo</em> (old talisman collection box) at the shrine.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Return to a nearby shrine:</strong> If you can't travel back to the original shrine,
                        most shrines accept ofuda from other shrines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dondo-yaki:</strong> A traditional bonfire event held around January 15, where New Year
                        decorations and ofuda are ceremonially burned.</li>
                    <li><strong>Respectful home disposal:</strong> If visiting a shrine isn't possible, you can place
                        the ofuda on white paper (<em>hanshi</em>), sprinkle it with coarse salt to purify it, wrap it
                        carefully, and dispose of it with combustible waste — ideally in a separate bag from other
                        trash. This method is widely accepted.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    What matters most isn't the method — it's <strong>the gratitude you carry while letting go</strong>.
                    However you choose to return or dispose of an ofuda, take a moment to thank it for the year of
                    protection it provided.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Summary: Start with One, Treat It with Care</h2>
                <p>
                    Enshrining ofuda can seem complex, but the first step is remarkably simple:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose a clean, high spot — south or east facing if possible.</li>
                    <li>A kamidana is nice but not necessary.</li>
                    <li>Jingū Taima goes in the center (or front).</li>
                    <li>Return old ofuda to a shrine after one year.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Consistency beats perfection.</strong> What matters most isn't getting every detail right —
                    it's honoring the connection between you and the sacred, in whatever form your life allows.

                <h3>Kamidana App</h3>
                <p>
                    In the Kamidana App, you can photograph your ofuda and display it on a digital kamidana. Even if
                    you're still figuring out where to place it physically, you can start honoring it digitally today.
