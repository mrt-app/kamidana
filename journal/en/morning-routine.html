          Do you reach for your phone the moment you wake up, only to be overwhelmed by a flood of news and
          notifications?
          This habit, known as "Doomscrolling," puts your brain in a reactive state, spiking stress hormones before your
          day even begins.
        </p>
        <p class="journal-lead">
          At Kamidana App, we invite you to transform your first interaction with your phone into a ritual of peace.
          Discover the **"Digital Sanpai"**—a modern morning routine to center your mind.

        <h2>1. The Impact of Morning Digital Noise</h2>
        <p>
          Checking social media while your brain is still waking up can disrupt your nervous system, leaving you in a
          "reactive" state all day. You end up responding to the world's chaos rather than acting on your own
          intentions.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid this, how you spend the first 60 seconds of your morning is crucial. Reclaiming this minute allows
          you to set the tone for the hours to follow.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Ancient Wisdom for Modern Life</h2>
        <p>
          In Japan, the tradition of tending a home altar (*Kamidana*) and offering a morning prayer has long been used
          to reset the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "Digital Sanpai" brings this ancient wisdom to your smartphone. Even without a physical altar, you can
          create a "Sacred Space" in your pocket, allowing you to find a moment of quiet strength regardless of where
          you are.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. The Flow of a Digital Sanpai</h2>
        <p>
          The morning ritual with the Kamidana App is a gentle, flowing experience designed to ground you in the present
          moment.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tending Offerings: Resetting Your Mind</strong><br>Opening the app brings you to your personal
            altar. By refreshing the offerings, you symbolically clear away yesterday's burdens and prepare yourself for
            a fresh start.</li>
          <li><strong>Receiving Wisdom: Guidance from the Calendar</strong><br>Next, draw an *Omikuji* (fortune), or
            reflect on a daily quote and the seasonal calendar. These provide a mindful focal point, replacing digital
            noise with meaningful insight.</li>
          <li><strong>Visiting the Backyard: Embracing Silence</strong><br>Finally, visit the fox in the backyard. There
            is no need to "achieve" anything. Simply observing the fox and the serene scenery allows you to cultivate a
            quiet, mental "blank space" before the day's demands begin.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. From Reactive to Intentional</h2>
        <p>
          The greatest benefit of a Digital Sanpai is taking back control of your focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of reacting to external triggers, you start your day from a place of quiet intention. This small shift
          leads to greater focus and a deeper sense of fulfillment when you finally put your phone down at night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stop letting your phone drain you. Starting tomorrow, give yourself the gift of a 1-minute Digital Sanpai and
          begin your day with peace.
