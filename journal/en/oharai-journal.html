            "I've had a terrible day and I just need someone to listen..."
            Have you ever started typing a post on social media, only to hesitate and delete it?
          </p>
          <p class="journal-lead">
            <em>"Is it okay to post something this negative?"</em><br>
            <em>"Will I regret seeing this later?"</em><br>

            Venting your emotions is vital for mental health—a practice often called "Journaling" or "Expressive Writing." 
          </p>
          <p class="journal-lead">
            However, in the digital world, our words often remain as permanent "records," creating a new kind of stress. Today, let’s explore a different habit: <strong>"Oharai Journaling"—the art of writing to let go.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>1. Why Paper Journals Often Fail</h2>
          <p>
            We’ve all been there: buying a beautiful notebook with the best intentions, only to stop after three pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s not just about lack of time. It’s often about psychological resistance:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fear of Revisiting:</strong> It’s painful to look back at past negative emotions.</li>
            <li><strong>The Pressure to "Write Well":</strong> Feeling like you need to craft perfect sentences.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy Risks:</strong> The constant worry that someone might find and read your private thoughts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Deep down, many of us feel a natural instinct to avoid "recording" our darkest or weakest moments.
          </p>

          <h2>2. A New Habit: What is an "Oharai Journal"?</h2>
          <p>
            The Kamidana app proposes a modern twist on an ancient Shinto tradition called <strong>Oharai (Purification)</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Shinto, there is a ritual where impurities (*Kegare*) are transferred onto a paper effigy called a *Katashiro* and then washed away in a river. Oharai Journaling applies this concept to your digital life.
          </p>

          <h3>Writing to Discard</h3>
          <p>
            The Kamidana app features a dedicated "Oharai" function that physically deletes what you’ve written.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it’s a frustration with work or feelings you can’t tell anyone else, you can vent them here freely, knowing they aren't meant to be kept forever.
          </p>

          <h3>A Ritual of Release at Your Fingertips</h3>
          <p>
            Once you’ve finished writing, take a deep breath and tap the "Oharai" button. The visual effect of the words disappearing is a signal to your brain that the stagnant energy is leaving your heart. This sense of liberation is something you won't find in a standard memo app or a paper notebook.
          </p>

          <h2>3. A Quiet Sanctuary (No AI, No Likes)</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike social media, the Kamidana app is a completely closed space. 
          </p>
          <p>
            There are no "Likes," no "Comments," and no AI analyzing your data to serve you ads. There is only the quiet presence of the "Fox" in the backyard. This absolute solitude provides a rare sanctuary where you can face your true self without judgment.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Conclusion: Wash Away Today’s Worries Today</h2>
          <p>
            Just as we clean our rooms to feel better, our minds need regular "decluttering." 
          </p>
          <p>
            By making "Oharai" a part of your nightly routine, you ensure that today’s stress doesn't rot and become tomorrow's burden. Before you sleep, entrust those unspoken feelings to the digital altar, and let them be washed away.
